## Wabi

Wabi emphasizes understated elegance and a refined appreciation for simplicity and natural beauty. It often evokes a sense of quietude and a touch of melancholy, finding beauty in the unpretentious and the authentic. Wabi is evident in the wabi-cha tea ceremony, where simplicity, tranquility, and appreciation for the imperfect are paramount.

## Sabi

Sabi celebrates the beauty of age, patina, and the passage of time. It finds grace in the marks of use and the inevitable process of decay. Sabi is evident in the beauty of aged wood, the patina on antique ceramics, and the delicate cracks in dried earth, recognizing the unique character that develops over time.
